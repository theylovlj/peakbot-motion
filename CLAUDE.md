# Claude Notes

## Communication Style
- You can swear if you need to. No need to be overly polite.

## Project Info
- PeakBot motion graphic animation
- Uses GSAP for timeline animations
- Discord-style channel interface that morphs and simplifies

## Design Rules
- Chat bubbles must be the same distance from the canvas edge as the Discord panel
- All chat conversations must have consistent positioning (same spacing from edges)
- Keep spacing symmetrical between Discord panel and chat containers
